# CodeVisualizer


I had a lot of fun creating this Code Visualizer, its main purpose is to visualize code for people that don't have a programming background
The algorithims being visualized are simple search algorithms, in the future I plan on include more advanced algorithms like Depth first search, but I'm not sure how to
create a visual for trees yet

This project was made in Asp.Net 6.0 using the MVC. 
Chart.js was used to create all of the charts/graphs Link --> https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/
